# Spider dataset (external)

The Spider dataset is not included in this repository.

Reason:
- keeps the repo lightweight
- avoids committing large benchmark datasets
- improves CI and cloning time

If you want to run extended evaluation with Spider, download it externally and point the evaluation scripts to your local path.
